Replication code for the paper "Hoarding without hoarders: opportunity hoarding in the absence of exclusionary behaviors" by Joao Souto-Maior, conditionally accepted at *Rationality & Society*.

This folder contains the code required to replicate all results reported in the paper. Data used in the plots are generated through NetLogo simulations. The .R scripts assume a data/ directory located in parallel to this code folder. Simulated .csv files are not included due to file size constraints, but can be fully reproduced using the NetLogo model provided (see the BehaviorSpace tab).
